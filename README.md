### What is Healthify?
#####
Healthify is a simple web application built for fitness casuals who need an easy way of tracking the foods that they are eating. We believe that by using natural language to add foods & meals & creating an intuitive interface *we will achieve* a higher rate of long-term engagement & more useful/actionable output for the user. We came up with this idea because many food tracking apps are too labor-intensive and focus too much on metrics. 


### Technologies Used:
#### Express
This app was built using the Express Generator App
